## About
Welcome to the YouAPI repository!

The YouAPI repository is a community-driven project that provides access to various APIs and libraries for interacting with the You.com platform. It is an unofficial collection of tools and resources that have been created and maintained by members of the You.com community.

With the YouAPI repository, you can access a range of You.com services and functionality through simple, easy-to-use interfaces. Whether you are a developer looking to build integrations with the You.com platform or a user looking to automate tasks, the YouAPI repository has something to offer.

To get started with the YouAPI repository, simply choose the API or library that best fits your needs and follow the provided documentation. We hope you find the YouAPI helpful and we welcome any feedback or contributions from the community.

## How To Use

To help users get started with the YouDotCom Python Library, we have provided a selection of code examples that demonstrate common use cases for the library. These examples can be found below and cover a range of functionality.

To use the code examples, simply copy and paste the relevant code into your Python script and customize it to fit your specific needs. You can also use the examples as a starting point for your own code, using them as a guide to understand how the library functions can be used to build your own applications and integrations with the You.com platform.

We hope that these code examples will make it easier for users to get up and running with the YouDotCom Python Library and start building with the You.com platform.

<summary>YouChat example</summary>
<br>
  
```python
from youdotcom.init import Init  # import the Init class
from youdotcom.youchat import Chat  # import YouChat

driver = Init().driver  # setting up the webdriver. use `webdriver_path=` if the pre-installed one does not work.


chat = Chat.send_message(driver=driver, message="how is your day?")  # send a message to YouChat. passing the driver and messages

driver.close()  # close the webdriver


print(chat)  # {'message': "It's been great! How about yours?", 'time': '11', 'error': 'False'}
```

This code imports two classes from the youdotcom library: Init and Chat. The Init class is used to set up a webdriver, which is a tool that allows you to automate web browsing tasks. The Chat class is used to send a message to the YouChat service.

First, the Init class is instantiated with Init(). The driver attribute of the resulting object is then stored in the driver variable. The driver attribute returns a webdriver object that can be used to automate web browsing tasks.

Next, the send_message method of the Chat class is called with driver and a message as arguments. This method sends the specified message to the YouChat service using the webdriver. The result of the method call is stored in the chat variable.

Finally, the webdriver is closed with driver.close(), and the value of chat is printed to the console.

<summary>YouCode (only code search for now) example</summary>
<br>
  
```python
from youdotcom.code import Code # import the YouCode class.
from youdotcom.init import Init # import the webdriver

driver = Init().driver # setting up the webdriver. use `webdriver_path=` if the pre-installed one does not work.

code = Code.find_code(driver, search="how to make an python loop?") # get all the code displayed on screen. passing the driver and search string.

for string in code['response']: # loop through all the code
    print(string) # print 1 at an time.
    
print(code['time']) # print the time taken to complete you search.
```
  
This code imports the Code and Init classes from the youdotcom library. The Code class is used to search for code snippets, while the Init class is used to set up a webdriver.

First, the Init class is instantiated with Init(). The driver attribute of the resulting object is then stored in the driver variable. The driver attribute returns a webdriver object that can be used to automate web browsing tasks.

Next, the find_code method of the Code class is called with driver and a search string as arguments. This method searches for code snippets related to the specified search string using the webdriver. The result of the method call is stored in the code variable.

The code variable is a dictionary containing a list of code snippets in the response field and the time taken to complete the search in the time field. The code then loops through the response list and prints each code snippet to the console one at a time. Finally, the time taken to complete the search is printed to the console.
